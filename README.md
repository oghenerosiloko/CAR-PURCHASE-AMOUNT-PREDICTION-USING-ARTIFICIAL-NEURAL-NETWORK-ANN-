##  Car Purchase amount Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
###  Problem Overview
This Project entails the design of a machine learning model to predict a Customer Car Purchase Amount using Artificial Neural Network. This is aimed at helping the  Car dealer Company and its Sales Team in making better marketing decision or marketing strategy targeted towards a specific customers car purchasing strength.

Informations about the previous customers purchase history contained in the dataset include;

Customer name, 
Customer email, 
Country,

Age, 
Annual Salary, 
Debit Card, 
Net worth, 
Car Purchase Amount.


My model will predict the amount of car a customer is most likely to purchase from previous customer history. Hence, my model will predict Car Purchase Amount.
